About me
I'm a 23 year old who lives in Winter Park. I've spent the last few years taking a break from training for the Olympics after acheiveing a Guiness World Record. Traveling around the world, learing diffrent cultures, building my network, as well as my capital. 
I have a passion for  innovation, and a desire to help as many people as my thoughts may travel.
Code will translate my passions into a structual force that will help build the new world. 
I look forward to having dynamic discussions with passionate people in all lines of work.
